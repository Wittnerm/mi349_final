                For past 25+ years, The main objective of Roadside has been to provide people in the St. Clair County area with top-notch service at competitive prices. Traditionally a shop-based business,
                Roadside has transitioned its model to a strictly mobile service center that works on-site from a "shop on wheels". Despite the new infrastructure of our business, we still provide the same
                quality people have come to expect from us over the years.

                    Roadside Truck & Fleet Repairs was founded by Rick Wittner and Conrad Delor in 1993. Rick and Conrad grew up together in Michigan, and both graduated from Northwestern Auto, Diesel and Business
                    School (now known as the University of Northwestern Ohio) in 1993. That year, they started their business at a shop in Marysville, MI where they worked for over 25 years. In June of 2020, Conrad
                    unfortunately passed away, leaving Rick to run the shop by himself. In October of 2020, Rick reopened Roadside Truck & Fleet Repairs as a stictly mobile diesel repair service, where he continues
                    to provide excellent customer service.
